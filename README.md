# EXcalibur
Optimising the Compiler created for the EXPL language.

### Project Objective
Develop a 3-address code generator for the Experimental Language (ExpL)  and perform a code optimization known as Local
Common Subexpression Elimination in the generated code. For simplicity, you may omit
composite data types, type definitions, user defined functions and dynamic memory
allocation from the ExpL specification.
